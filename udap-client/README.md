# Getting Started
- To leverage the UDAP Test Tool, you must be issued a "UDAP Test Certificate NOT FOR USE WITH PHI" for your FHIR CLIENT APP
- https://www.udap.org/UDAPTestTool/

# Environment Setup

The values shown below are examples. Set the according to your development environment setup (e.g., Eclipse Run or Debug Configurations)

```console
# If FHIR CLIENT is already registered
UDAP_DEMO_FHIR_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-0123456789

## What does it support
The repository contains components and example uses to support the following items from [Security for Scalable Registration, Authentication, and Authorization](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/udap-security/).  The intent is to also support generic UDAP, but the driving force currently is supporting auto registration to FHIR® servers.  FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7. Use of the FHIR trademark does not constitute endorsement of the contents of this repository by HL7

# UDAP Test Tool

## Test 3: Trusted dynamic client registration
1. FHIR Client examines FHIR sever for trustworthiness
	- Client application retrieves metadata from the following [FHIR server - Base URL](https://test.udap.org/fhir/r4/stage)
2. FHIR Client performs JWT validation and evalutation to assert trustworthiness
	- If FHIR server is considered trusted, FHIR client (this app) performs UDAP Trusted Dynamic Client registration at FHIR Servers registration endpoint
	- FHIR client submits a software statement signed with the private key corresponding to the app's UDAP test certificate
